# Tesla Stock Price Prediction using Random Forest Regressor
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning to predict Tesla's stock prices using the Random Forest Regressor algorithm. It aims to provide insights into the historical stock price trends and make future price predictions based on historical data.

# Project Overview
Objective: To build a machine learning model that can predict Tesla's stock prices based on historical data.

**Data Source:** Historical stock price data for Tesla.

**Algorithm Used:** Random Forest Regressor

# Key Features:

  Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and scaling of historical stock price data.
  Model Building: Training a Random Forest Regressor model on historical data.
  Price Prediction: Using the trained model to predict future stock prices.
  Visualization: Plotting actual vs. predicted stock prices for analysis.

# Prerequisites
Before running the project, you will need the following libraries and tools installed:
  Python (version 3.x)
  NumPy
  pandas
  scikit-learn
  matplotlib

# Usage
**Data Preparation**: Prepare the historical stock price data for Tesla. This data should include features such as date, open price, close price, high price, low price, and volume.

**Data Preprocessing:** Perform data preprocessing steps, including cleaning and scaling of data. The code for data preprocessing is available in the project.

**Model Training:** Train the Random Forest Regressor model on historical data. You can use the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script for this purpose.

**Price Prediction:** Use the trained model to make predictions for future stock prices. The predictions can be plotted to visualize how well the model performs.

**Visualization:** Visualize the actual vs. predicted stock prices using matplotlib. This helps in evaluating the model's accuracy.
